". Human: hello how are you. AI: Hello! I'm an AI, so I don't have feelings, but I'm here to assist you. How can I help you today?. Human: tell me a good strategy for investing in stocks in sonnet form. AI: In market's dance, be not a fleeting guest,\nDiversify, in this wisdom, invest.\nBlue chips for stability, they're tried and true,\nSmall caps for growth, a balanced view.\n\nPatience is virtue, hold stocks with grace,\nIn market's ebb and flow, find your pace.\nResearch with diligence, knowledge is key,\nIn the company's future, what do you see?\n\nDon't let emotions guide your hand,\nIn market's storm, firm you stand.\nBuy low, sell high, the golden rule,\nIn this game, let not greed rule.\n\nRemember, risk is part of the quest,\nIn stocks, as in life, hope for the best."
