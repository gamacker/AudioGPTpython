Our understanding of the universe is constantly evolving as scientists study and explore its mysteries.. Human: tell me a little tiny bit more about that. AI: Certainly! In addition to galaxies, stars, planets, moons, asteroids, and comets, the universe also contains other fascinating entities such as black holes, nebulae, and cosmic radiation. Black holes are extremely dense objects with such strong gravitational pull that even light cannot escape from them. Nebulae are vast gas and dust clouds where new stars are formed. Cosmic radiation consists of high-energy particles that constantly bombard the universe, originating from various sources like supernovae or distant galaxies. The study of all these phenomena helps us unravel the secrets of the universe and our place within it."
